RESULTS ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION
4.1 Implementation of Design
The virtual environment was successfully deployed using VMware Workstation. Security tools were installed and configured according to best practices.
4.2 Design Drawings/Schematics
•	Network topology diagrams illustrate the segmentation and isolation of test environments.
•	Detailed screenshots of tool configurations and dashboards.
4.3 Testing/Characterization
4.3.1 Test Cases
•	Simulated port scanning and brute-force attacks.
•	Monitored and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark.
•	Detected and responded to simulated intrusions with Snort/Suricata.
4.3.2 Data Validation
•	All attacks were detected by IDS/IPS.
•	Incident response procedures were executed and documented.
•	Network monitoring tools provided actionable insights.
4.4 Interpretation
The environment enabled effective detection and response to simulated threats, validating the utility of the CIS framework for training and experimentation.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
5.1 Deviation from Expected Results
Minor configuration issues were encountered during tool integration, but were resolved through iterative testing.
5.2 Way Ahead
•	Expand the environment to include cloud-based scenarios.
•	Integrate advanced security analytics and automation.
•	Develop guided training modules for specific attack/response scenarios.
