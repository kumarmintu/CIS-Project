3.1 Concept Generation
The project envisions a virtual cybersecurity scenario that mimics actual network configurations, with multiple operating systems and security technologies. This will allow students to gain hands-on experience in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities in a real-world scenario. Through the simulation of various cyber attacks, students can develop practical skills in protecting against potential threats. In addition, the virtual world will provide a safe place for students to try out different security methods and strategies without jeopardizing actual-world consequences. This experiential method will more effectively ready students for future careers in cybersecurity by sharpening their problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities. In general, the inclusion of virtual laboratories in cybersecurity education can significantly enhance the learning process and prepare students more effectively for the challenges they will face in the workplace. It also provides a cost-saving option for universities that want to provide great hands-on training to a large number of students.
